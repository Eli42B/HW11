HW 11 for Kristine, Nathan, and Elizabeth


# @ Kristine and Nathan 
Hi! I have created data for Assignment 11. Don't look at HW11_Elizabeth.R yet because that is the code that created the data and you'll be able to see what the true equations are there. Here is my question prompt: 

King Uther Pendragon is having some trouble with dragons in his medieval kingdom. White dragons and red dragons keep setting fire to the kingdom. He wants to hire a private contractor named Merlin (occupation: Wizard) to relocate the dragons, but private contractors are really expensive and Merlin can only capture half the dragons. The dragons are also all different sizes. Should Uther have Merlin capture the red dragons, the white dragons, or does it only matter how large the dragons are matter? Oddly enough, Uther has excellent ecological data on all the dragons.

Question: Do the numbers of acres set on fire depend on the size of white and red dragons? 
 Continuous response variable: Number of acres set on fire 
  # type = numeric
  # unit = acre 
 Continuous predictor variable: Dragon size 
  # type = numeric 
  # unit = tons 
 Two level factor: Color of dragon 
  # type =  categorical 

You can create your own R files and read in my data (use read.csv("elizabeth_data.csv")) and it should load OK, and then analyze it to answer Uther's question.
